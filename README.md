# odin-recipes
This the first project that I will be doing under The Odin Project. This project entails building a basic recipe website.
The project will focus on the objectives that were covered in the lessons that introduced HTML which means that the website I'll be buiding will only contain elements of the website without any styling.
The reason for this is because there will not be any CSS used.
